# Windows Better Esc
- Uses the f13 key.
- Press and release to Esc.
- Press, hold and press other keys to Ctrl + other key.
- If other keys are pressed while f13 is held down, Esc would not be sent.
- If you want to change the f13 key, its in key.rs.
- To close the program, go to task manager and find better_esc.exe and end task.
- Also does not work with Ctrl + Shift + something. It would just send Ctrl + Shift and Ctrl + something. Need to fix this.
- Also need to add run on startup.

## Only works in Windows
- Change CapsLock to f13 in the registry or something. Up to you.
